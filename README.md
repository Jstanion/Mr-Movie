## Usage

When navigated to the homepage of this website, Mr.Movie, you will see a top navigation bar with two drop-down elements and a search bar component. If you click on either drop-down bar you will be given a list of either: years dating from 1960-2021 or 21 different movie genres. When decided which drop-down to select from and have choosen from the list of the two, then you will be prompted with a random movie, based off the criteria selected to watch. You can only choose the elements from one drop-down at a time, but don't worry! You can always click on the home button when the movie prompt pulls up and it will refresh the homepage to try again! The same will apply for the search bar in the top right corner of the navigation area. Type in an actor or title: "ex: Tom Hanks" and then a random Tom Hanks movie will be displayed on the screen with a home button to refresh the page if need be. If you have typed in an error, or our web api does not read what is being asked for; the page will be directed to a "404 error page" and you will be able to click on the "Mr.Movie" on the top left corner of the page to go back home.

When you scroll down to the main section of the page there is a "feeling lucky" paragraph. If you are feeling the luck of the irish go ahead and click on the dancing movie condiments and be surprised by the redirect to the "Single Options Page" where a movie is genrated and provided for you by our completely random movie API generator. 

When scrolled all the way down, near the footer of the website, displayed is a popcorn bucket carousel.. have yours popping yet? Listed below are the 21 movie genres from previously. However, this time if clicked upon you will be redirected to our "Multi Option Page" where there will be 3 movie images displayed to choose from based of the genre you have clicked upon. If it is taking some time to load, you will see a short gif display on the page, but don't worry we promise they are coming! Again, if not satisfied with the movie selections, Mr.Movie will be at the top left corner of the page to redirect you back to home and start all over! 

Now our job is done! So, get that popcorn popping, turn the surround sound on relax!

### Techincal Features:

    Server-Side API: 
    Allows we, as the developers, to interact with project by enabling third-party developers to integrate software into code. Making it fully functional and easier to pull large amounts of data such as the movie info, actor info, and genre info. We used two API's in the project and ran the first one to grab title and actor id's and then passed that information through a more robust API to get movie posters and other info.

    Allowed us to store data in web browser even after closing, reopening, or refeshing pages; specifically used when loading "Multi Option Page". 

    Responsive Design:
    Allows users and developers to view webpage on different screen dimensions and it still be fully fuctional.
